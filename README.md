# Automated-Vehicle-Document-Verification-system

The project can be a revolutionary idea in order to resolve the problems associated with the current vehicle check points and can act as an accurate thief recognition system in case of vehicle theft.The project idea came by the observation of current scenario. As the roads are well developed and vehicles are able to move swiftly then there is no need to stop at check points if driver is carrying all documents and are legally correct. Also there is an urgent need to develop a system which can eradicate the corruption caused by some corpse at check points and a system which can accurately recognize thief in case of vehicle theft.
To insure road safety and ultimately the safety of citizens and resources different security services checkouts the vehicles and drivers, but many times these check points leads to wastage of time, resources, lack of transparency and also leads to corruption. Thus there is an urgent need to update the current check points and procedure.
Also there is a need of thief recognition system in case of vehicle theft.In India there is no system which can automatically detect which person has invalid vehicle papers.The proposed model is an Automated vehicle document verification system which will detect the vehicles with driver having invalid papers directly. 
Proposed model will provide the sense of equality among all the drivers and will save time on checkpoints.
